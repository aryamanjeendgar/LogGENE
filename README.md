Tasks to work on for now: 

1. Recreate all of the experiments from the LipGene paper for our setting (i.e. loss == log-cosh, optimizer == adaH, LRscheduler == LALR) -- also redo all of the lipgene tests in our environment to ensure a fair comparison
2. The same also has to be done on the datasets used in adaSwarm, in addition, there also work with BCE and some binary classification datasets (hence, would have to adapt all of our other work so far to the classification setting)
